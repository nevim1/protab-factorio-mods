In this repo there will be for now two mod directories `resourceOutpostGenerator` and `mainBusProduction`.

Both of these tool are laze base building tools.

resorceOutpostGenerator
----
In this tool you mark some resource patch and it will automatically make an outpost for mining that resouce with an infrastructure that will transport that mined items to a point you specified.


mainBusProduction
----
In this tool you define how your main bus is set up, then you pick waht product/item you want to make and how much of it and this tool will calculate optimal ratios of assemblers or other machines. Then it make a blueprint or paste it into the world (as ghosts).
